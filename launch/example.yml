# Firing mode
# 0: Fire simultaneously, each round taking about 100ms
# 1: Fire sequencially. each round taking about N_sensor*100ms
# 2: Fire unadjacent sensors simultaneously, in the order of (sensor_id mod fire_mod_n), each round taking about fire_mod_n*100ms
fire_mode: 2

# Used when fire_mode is set to 2

# Frequence, of type double
freq: 1.0

# Addresses of ks103 sensors
# Index should start from 1, be consecutive and surrounded by ""
# e.g. "1": 0x6c
# The order of the addresses should reflect the physical layout of the sensors to take advantage of fire_mode 2
# Support up to 20 sensors, since ks103 can only be configured to 20 different addresses
